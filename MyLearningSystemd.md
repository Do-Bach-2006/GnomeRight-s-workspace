## HOT FIX

- [ ] BUG: Not cache the todo and chat history when changing video 
		we should install a sessions cache for todo and chat history.

			 -Second time: We could just get from it


## Backing

- [ ] FEATURE: Install courses via torrent 
		 - Create the UI for user to enter the course name
		 - Get only the course
		 - Get the course and extract all the data into a directory( user choice, default 
		 - Downloads/courses ) and add that course path into the program
- [ ] STYLE: add more themes and switch between themes 
		 - Change background when change theme 
		 - Change colorscheme
- [ ] FEATURE: roadmaps
		 - Allow user to create a roadmap based on added courses. ( or they name it)
		 - Using topological sort to suggest course for the user.


## Todo

- [ ] FEATURE: play a chillon song when pause (user can choose their song)
- [ ] FEATURE: Congrats the user when done learning ( if promodo rounds equal 0 ) and do not let them learn anymore.
- [ ] FEATURE: Display the completion of the course based on the number of completed video.
